# GameStore API Project

This project is a RESTful API for managing games and genres in a game store. It demonstrates how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using .NET and Entity Framework Core with a SQLite database.

---

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlirezaNoorizadeh/GameStore.git
```

### 2. Database Setup
The project uses SQLite as the database, which is configured automatically:
- The database file `GameStore.db` will be created when you run the application for the first time.
- No additional connection string configuration is needed for development.

### 3. Apply Database Migrations
Run the following command to apply the existing migrations:
```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

### 4. Build and Run the Project
- Build the project:
```bash
dotnet build
```
- Run the project:
```bash
dotnet run
```

### 5. Test the API
The project includes `.http` files for testing the API endpoints:
- Use `games.http` to test game-related endpoints
- Use `genres.http` to test genre-related endpoints

## üéØ Project Goal
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to:
- Create a RESTful API with .NET
- Implement CRUD operations for games and genres
- Use Entity Framework Core with SQLite
- Implement proper DTOs and mapping
- Organize a clean project structure

## üîó Database Relationships
The project uses the following entity relationships:
- **Game to Genre**: Many-to-One relationship (Many games can belong to one genre)
  - Each `Game` has a `GenreId` foreign key
  - Each `Game` has a navigation property `Genre`
  - Each `Genre` can be associated with multiple `Game` entities

- Data annotations on DTOs for validation rules

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies Used
- **.NET** for the API framework
- **Entity Framework Core** for database operations
- **SQLite** as the database

## üôè Acknowledgments
Special thanks to:
- The .NET and Entity Framework Core communities for their excellent documentation and support.
- **[Julio Casal](https://www.youtube.com/@juliocasal)** for his comprehensive tutorial video ["ASP.NET Core Full Course For Beginners"](https://youtu.be/AhAxLiGC7Pc) which served as the foundation for this implementation. This project follows the architecture and patterns demonstrated in his tutorial.

The implementation in this project closely follows the concepts and structure taught in Julio Casal's tutorial video, adapted specifically for a game store management system. The clean architecture, endpoint organization, and data access patterns all reflect the approaches demonstrated in that excellent beginner-friendly course.
